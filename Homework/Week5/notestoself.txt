- strip off header of csv in CSV2JSON.py

- problem dates reading json

- crosshair

- keep axes the same: load all data at once?
- if so, a slider instead of buttons?

First, make the json work (dates)
1. list with three dataset,  all loaded (can be 1 json, or 3 jsons loaded in one array)
2. buttons that toggle between elements of that list (but axes based on all three?)

- interactivity

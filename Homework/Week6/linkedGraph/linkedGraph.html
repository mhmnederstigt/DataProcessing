          <h2>Pillars of sustainability</h2>
          <p> The triple bottom line is a theory generally applied to sustainability thinking within companies. It is the most commonly used depiction of sustainability and poses that in pursuit of sustainable daily business three bottom lines, or in other words ‘pillars’, should be considered. The three pillars comprises a social and environmental factor (people and planet) and additionally a third factor that is the core driver of the system; in organizations the financial factor: profit. Therefore it has also been described as the ‘three P’s of sustainability’. In the figure above theory has been applied to a wider context: the pursuit of global sustainability.</p>
          <p> Hans Rosling’s famous scatter plot on the right hand side indicates that there is a relationship between life expectancy and wellfare. One could argue that in pursuit of sustainability all three pillars of sustainability should be considered and effort should be put in the least supporting pillar. Information on those pillars it thus relevant. This model makes use of the indicators ‘hunger’, ‘renewable energy’ and ‘wellbeing’. </p>
          <p>For instance, within Europe Norway might be known for its high renewable energy production, however the renewable energy share (% of total production) is lower than how citizens rate their wellbeing. If people are generally happy, there should be room to improve more, right? Therefore it matters.</p>

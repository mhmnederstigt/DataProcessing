Glyphosate is a polar compound, i.e. it has a high ratio of polar bonds in comparison to non-polar bonds in which a polar bond
is being defined a difference in charge between bonded atoms due to a difference in electronnegativity. Since a bond between two carbon atoms is 
non-polar a long chain of carbon atoms in comparison to functional groups such as -COOH or -OH results in a non-polar compound. 
Glyphosate on the other hand has a relatively short carbon chain and several polar bonds, NH and OH. Therefore it can be classified as polar and it
easily dissolves in water through the formation of hydrogen bonds. 
Its chemical structure also allows for deprotonation, which result in negative charged sites that contribute to the molecule's capacity to sorb to soils. 
Both intermedia and intramedia transport plays a role in how glyphosate travels through the environment. A key concept in this would be that
an equilibrium is sought... . If present in the soil water glyphosate will be transported along with the water through a process called advection. However, 
if this occurs, for instance due to seepage or any process and soil water is replaced by water from a different source, the equilibrium between glyphosate in 
solution and the amount that is sorpted to the soil has to set again. Assuming the water is still in contact, a gradient in the concentration of glyphosate exists,
and diffusion, both by intermedia and intramedia means, will occurs to establish the equilibrium once again.
